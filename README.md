- This project is part of the [Udacity React Developer Nanodegree](https://www.udacity.com/course/react-nanodegree--nd019).

- Users play the “Would You Rather?” game. A user is asked a question in the form: “Would you rather [option A] or [option B] ?”. Answering "neither" or "both" is against the rules.
